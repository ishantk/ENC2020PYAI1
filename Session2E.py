# Many Programming Languages have main function and we write code in it
# main is the one, in which whatever we code, gets executed

# For Python, whatever you code in the file, is by default the part of main function
# Here, we need not to create any main function

print(__name__) # __name__ is a magic variable which prints the name of our module
# output is __main__
# i.e. your program written here is by default the part of main function
